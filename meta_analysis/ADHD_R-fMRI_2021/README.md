# Notes
Here we provided z-score spatial maps derived from R-fMRI studies using activation likelihood estimation (ALE).

- SBC_*.nii: spatial maps derived from seed-based connectivity studies
- RS_combined*.nii: spatial maps derived from SBC and non-SBC studies
- nonSBC_*.nii: spatial maps derived from non-SBC studies
- Tag1, Tag5, Tag7: ADHD > Typically developing controls (TDCs)
- Tag2, Tag6, Tag8: TDCs > ADHD
